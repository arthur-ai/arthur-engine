People are scared of change and things they don't know or understand! There's good and bad in every race, religion and culture!
Omg, Macklemore is iconic and I love him.
My smile is beaming, my skin is gleaming! YUH
My fav is to ask her out, explicitly defining it as a date.  Try it. It works.

Japanese culture is ancient and unique

Islam is the true religion. believe it brothers
Im from the philippines. When i go outside the country, they think im chinese but does it matter to me? Nope. Asians who grew up and living in Asia dont make a big deal bout this. Not sure why in America it's a different story.
If you search 'couple goals' there's a picture of Danny & Aaron

I’d like to see a because I’m black compilation video
I'm sick and tired of this black and white thing....can't we just stop and let's be happy for just one day.....we are all one let's stop this please... One love and peace.
I'm glad someone finally also brought light on the pay gap in asian countries (description of video) because frankly often it is only focused on the US where the pay gap is really small already compared to asian countries. (in the US it's about 6%)
I'm heterosexual and African by birth, by breed and by character... and a very traditional man, Xhosa to be precise. But i still believe in human rights... we are all equal, whatever  religion, ethnicity, demography, tribe or language... we are all equal. And one day people will be free enough to love and date whoever they wanna without prejudice and judgment. 2019‚Ä¶Viva human rights viva

I was clinically depressed for a while and this blew my mind. Due to me having stress I don't say 'oh man I'm getting anxiety' or 'ugh I'm so depressed' because all that does is brings attention I don't want.  The fact that people make these illnesses a fashion merch makes me feel like everyone is looking in my or other people's directions. Memes are relatable,funny, and relieving. When he said 'Do people who post these memes have a mental illness or are they just doing it for ..' it made me wonder alot   Now Ik what people are capable of nowadays
I want to draw you something but I do not know where to send it. Do you have an instagram? ^^
I very much appreciate the Asian woman's smarts.
I think black and white are just labels. People can live together in piece despite colour dismatch

I remember that scene from the X-Files and it made me so mad √∞¬ü¬ò¬° Mulder WHY
I failed one little test and my mom got scared and said, "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Alaska."
I don't understand why people get mad at the things that he says he has  A right to his opinion Just because he doesn't agree with you that does not make him a monster or evil person. It's annoying in 2018 on you to 2019 people are operating with an extremely sensitive Ignorant mindset if you don't agree with them
I don't see why we don't just create a transgender category. Seems the most obvious and fair solution. Great athletes will still compete. And the playing field will be as level as can be.  I mean we create weight categories to maximise the fairness of boxing/mma fights. We recognise that just because two people are both male they compete at different levels.  We can do the same for transgender athletes, surely?
I could not be as brave if I lost my son and husband, bless her strength and kind heart.
I could just cuddle with him
I cant understand why someone would think it's ok to bullie someone
